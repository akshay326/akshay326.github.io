# Support SDP constraints, add windows appveyor build, make DiffOpt.jl robust

Hi all! This blog is one of a series marking my progress in [Differentiable Optimization Problems](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5232064888045568).
You may enjoy reading [my first blog](http://www.imakshay.com/post/8). 

### The project - progress
Milestones completed:
1. Adding appveyor build to CI - [PR #29](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl/pull/29)
2. Testing the whole `contconic.jl` test suite and supporting the latest Julia version on CI - [PR #28](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl/pull/28)
3. Extracting matrices dynamically and supporting SDP constraints - [PR #30](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl/pull/30) 

> Bonus: Had JuMP Developer call on July 24th - find the [related notebook here](https://github.com/AKS1996/jump-gsoc-2020/blob/master/JuMP_devcall_24July2020.ipynb)


## What's next?
For the next two weeks, we'll focus on
1. Adding matrix builder code to [MatrixOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MatrixOptInterface.jl) and using it as a dependency in DiffOpt.jl
2. Adding projections on cones and their derivatives to [MathOptSetDistances.jl](https://github.com/matbesancon/MathOptSetDistances.jl) and and using it as a dependency in DiffOpt.jl
