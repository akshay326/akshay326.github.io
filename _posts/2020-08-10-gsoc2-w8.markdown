# Move DiffOpt.jl code to other JuMP-dev packages; Begin documenting the code

Hi all! This blog is one of a series marking my progress in [Differentiable Optimization Problems](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5232064888045568). You may enjoy reading [my first blog](http://www.imakshay.com/post/8). 

### The project - progress
Milestones completed:
1. Adding projections on cones and their derivatives to [MathOptSetDistances.jl](https://github.com/matbesancon/MathOptSetDistances.jl) ([PR#5](https://github.com/matbesancon/MathOptSetDistances.jl/pull/5)) and using it as a dependency in DiffOpt.jl ([PR#35](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl/pull/35))
2. Moving the matrix builder code to [MatrixOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MatrixOptInterface.jl) - [PR#7](https://github.com/jump-dev/MatrixOptInterface.jl/pull/7)
3. Initial version of documentation - https://aks1996.github.io/DiffOpt.jl/dev/

> Minor contribution ([PR#1098](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1132)) in JuMP Development Sprint :)


## What's next?
Finaly we arrive at the last two weeks of the summer program. We'll focus on
1. Supporting sparse structures to speed up computations - [Issue#31](https://github.com/AKS1996/DiffOpt.jl/issues/31)
2. Comprehensively document the codebase developed
