Last weekend, I conducted an introductory workshop on Game Theory @ IIT Varanasi. It was primarily aimed for freshers 
and newbies to Game Theory. 

### What was covered?
We covered basic topics such as elements of a game, IESDS and the concept of equilibrium. We discussed several classical
games alongwith many contemporary applications of Game Theory.
